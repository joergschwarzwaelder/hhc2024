**Achievement: [Silver] Elf Minder 9000**

## Hard
For the gold achievement, level 13 "A Real Pickle" has to be completed. This was done using a browser console (context "ELF MINDER 9000") to inject a tunnel exit element on the target flag.
Positioned elements:
```
game.entities=[[1,1,0],[11,9,1],[9,9,3],[11,7,3],[7,9,3],[5,9,3],[3,9,3],[1,9,3],[11,5,3],[9,5,3],[7,3,3],[5,1,3],[3,3,3],[1,3,3],[9,1,2],[5,3,2],[3,7,2],[7,7,2],[11,3,3],[11,1,3],[3,1,7],[9,3,7],[11,9,6],[1,7,6]]
```
Path:
```
game.segments=[[[1,1],[2,1]],[[2,1],[3,1]],[[8,1],[9,1]],[[9,1],[9,2]],[[9,2],[9,3]],[[9,6],[9,7]],[[9,7],[8,7]],[[8,7],[7,7]],[[7,7],[6,7]],[[6,7],[5,7]],[[5,7],[5,6]],[[5,6],[5,5]],[[5,5],[5,4]],[[5,4],[5,3]],[[4,7],[3,7]],[[3,7],[2,7]],[[1,7],[2,7]],[[11,9],[10,9]]]
```

## additional
### edit mode
By adding a `edit=1` to the game URL, a level editor in started.
### sanity checks
By manipulating "game.segments" it is even possible to have diagonal paths. But due to sanity checks the level completion is not awarded.
### too many springs
If more than two springs are positioned in the level, a "whyCantIHoldAllTheseSprings" is sent to the console.
### Spring jump to [0,0]
If the player jumps using a spring and in the jump direction there is no path, but a positioned element, the player jumps to [0,0]
